Just a quick note to pass the time until the next full article:
I made a contribution to last year's LOAD magazine.
You can find the download link for issue 7 here:

https://www.classic-computing.org/load-online/

My article is called "Do it yourself 80486" and describes a retro
machine that I assembled for that occasion (and kept afterwards).
I finished the project about a year ago, but the magazine was not publicly
available before mid of last year.

Unfortunately, the article is in German and not very detailed due to space constraints.
If you are interested in the topic, though, I can provide you with more information.
Just send me an email.

An update should be coming soon (sooner than 2.5 years for sure ;) ).

See you then!
