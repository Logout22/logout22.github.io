            <p><strong>tl;dr If you are only interested in how I made my case (haha)
you can jump to the next section</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="#required-parts">Required&nbsp;parts</a></p>
<p>About four months ago I got a <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/27629-game">uGame10</a> for my birthday. I had seen a presentation
on the device at <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span> a couple of days before and was immediately hooked,
so I decided to put a wish out to my friends. Thanks again guys!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>When I finally unboxed the chip I was surprised how tiny it was.
Seeing a device this small, featuring a well-known Nintendo-like
set of buttons, I was reminded of the small toy alarm clocks
Nintendo used to make under their brand of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Mini_Classics">Nintendo Mini Classics</a>.
I had a lot of fun with those mini arcade machines as a child and still
admire the addictive simplicity with which those games were made. And now I held
a template for such a machine in my hands, and could develop my very own
pocket game machine. How&nbsp;exciting!</p>
<p>It turned on fine when I connected it to a computer and, after a firmware update,
it ran all two example programs available on the web just fine. However,
having a mobile device connected to a wall outlet or a bulky power bank
all the time kind of defeats the point. Consequently, uGame was always designed
to run off battery power. uGame&#8217;s inventor, Radomir Dopieralski, recommends
to solder a specific Nokia phone battery from the 2000s directly
to the pads on the device and then hot-glue it to the back of the board
(see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python-ugame/ugame-docs/blob/ad676d121e3c583d1658f54e65a392fbcf29861f/assembly.rst">uGame manual</a>).</p>
<p>If this sounds dangerous to you: It is. Soldering irons, or worse soldering guns,
get very hot, and the Lithium, which is what the old battery is made of,
tends to take heat as an invitation to react with everything in its proximity.
Also, the contact pads and their insulation were built to a price point,
and are very thin and brittle. Soldering on them is certainly not easy,
and it is easy to damage or destroy the insulation, which could have
all kinds of unintended consequences. But then again,
Radomir goes to great lengths explaining that the device is a prototype
for experienced hobbyists and not a childrens&#8217;&nbsp;toy.</p>
<p>In addition to the risky way of fixing the battery that I did not want to follow,
I faced the problem
that I did not have the specific Nokia battery that was recommended in the manual.
Hence, none of the case designs available online for 3D printing would have
worked for me (e.g. by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2971913">Jovan Maric</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2797538">davedarko</a>).
I could have bought a used battery online, but you never know
what state you will receive them in.
I had another Nokia battery from the era handy which I tried, but I had no
luck attaching wires to the battery&#8217;s pads&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>However, I was able to try if the board worked with a battery at all, and it did.
I had soldered wires to the uGame, pushed the other end to the battery,
and the screen was flashing on nice and bright as it did on a wire lead.
Naturally, the uGame went
off again when I let go, but after that short experiment I was confident
that there was a way to make this work, albeit probably not
with this exact&nbsp;battery.</p>
<p>I am a trained computer engineer and I have no idea of materials or 3D printing.
Even if I asked my friends for help and designed a sophisticated case for &#8220;my&#8221;
Nokia battery,
including spring contacts to hold it in place firmly, a small <span class="caps">PCB</span>
to extract the leads, and a snap-in plastic housing for the uGame,
the case would only fit the one Nokia battery that I own.
If the battery broke down it would be completely useless.
Also, I work an unrelated full-time job, and this is not my only hardware project,
so time is limited to some degree. Thinking along those lines, I found I best
try something I have some experience with, and came up with a custom
&#8220;sandwich&#8221; case&nbsp;design.</p>
<div class="section" id="required-parts">
<h2>Required&nbsp;parts</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">a <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/27629-game">uGame10</a> prototype&nbsp;board</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">two through-hole printed circuit&nbsp;boards</p>
<p>The boards should feature individual soldering points to avoid short circuits
when attaching the battery. Mounting holes for the cable ties (see below)
come in handy,&nbsp;too.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">a 3.7 volts Lithium battery (e.g. Sony <span class="caps">US18650V3</span>) and a matching&nbsp;holder</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">some wire, ideally two&nbsp;colours</p>
<p>I prefer solid wire, some prefer stranded wire, your choice&nbsp;basically.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">about four zip ties to attach the two boards&nbsp;together</p>
<p>I would recommend having more handy,
as those fiddly beasts tend to get lost easly.
Sometimes you will also need to cut them when
you tied the wrong things together, unless you are one
of those Houdinis who can disassemble zip ties without
breaking&nbsp;them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assembly">
<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>First, mount the battery holder to one of the boards.
Put it on the side of the board that does not have soldering points on it,
so that you will later be able to solder its connectors to the board.
You may need to punch or drill small holes in the board to be able to
fasten the battery holder properly. Make sure the holder does not shake or wobble
when you are done: Lithium batteries are quite heavy
and require solid&nbsp;fastening.</p>
<img alt="The PCB mounted in a vice" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/01_pcb.jpg" />
<img alt="The PCB mounted in a vice with the battery holder attached to its back" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/02_pcb_holder_back.jpg" />
<img alt="The PCB mounted in a vice with the battery holder attached to its front" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/03_pcb_holder_front.jpg" />
<p>Now solder the battery holder contacts to the circuit board,
and attach some wire to the solder joints. I recommend red wire for the
battery&#8217;s positive end and white for the negative one.
<strong>Always mind the correct polarity</strong>:
If polarity is reversed when connecting
the battery to the board you may destroy both the battery and the&nbsp;uGame!</p>
<img alt="The PCB with the soldered battery holder and wires" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/04_soldered_holder.jpg" />
<p>Now, solder the other ends of the wires to the back of your uGame board,
matching the polarity of the battery,
and attach the screen to the front of the uGame as described
in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python-ugame/ugame-docs/blob/ad676d121e3c583d1658f54e65a392fbcf29861f/assembly.rst">uGame manual</a>.
If you insert the battery now, you should already be able to turn on the
uGame using the small up/down switch on the side.
<strong>Again, mind the polarity when inserting the battery into the finished circuit!</strong>
After turning on the uGame, the whole setup should look somewhat
like the picture&nbsp;below.</p>
<img alt="The PCB with the soldered battery holder and uGame running" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/05_soldered_ugame.jpg" />
<p>For the remaining pictures, I turned the uGame off again, because the bright
light from the screen can be really disturbing when fiddling with those tiny
components, but do not worry, it was working all the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Now you will need the other circuit board and the zip&nbsp;ties.</p>
<img alt="The additional components needed to finish the case, neatly arranged" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/06_required_additional_components.jpg" />
<p>I know, the arrangement is far from perfect, and I need more training
before I can attend <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEN5-_93gQg">Stackenblocken</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes the fiddly part: Put all cable ties through the holes
that you need to connect. Try to attach as many mounting holes of the
uGame to the two boards as you can, and connect both boards with all cable
ties to make sure the case stays small and compact and the battery
is properly secured within. I recommend you put the ugame on the side
of the second board which is not fit with solder points. Even though
it is not likely to form a short circuit if you have boards with individual
solder joints, you are on the safe side if there is no metal on the board
under the uGame&#8217;s back side at&nbsp;all.</p>
<img alt="All zip ties pushed through the boards and the uGame, but not zipped" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/07_all_zip_ties.jpg" />
<p>Now, carefully close the cable ties, going in small steps of few centimeters
on each of them in round robin so that you get a somewhat straightly aligned case.
You may need multiple cable ties to attach them in the correct&nbsp;fashion.</p>
<img alt="The finished case from the side" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/08_case_side.jpg" />
<img alt="The finished case from the top" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/09_case_top.jpg" />
<img alt="Front view of the finished case" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/10_case_front.jpg" />
<p>Now, when you connect the finished sandwich to the computer again,
it should start charging the battery and light the <span class="caps">CHARGE</span> indicator <span class="caps">LED</span>.</p>
<img alt="The running uGame with on the sandwich case with CHARGE LED on" src="https://logout22.github.io/images/11_charging.jpg" />
<p>I hope this blog post was somewhat useful to you. If you have any questions
or remarks feel free to send me a message (see <a class="reference external" href="/about/">About</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks for&nbsp;reading!</p>
<p>P.S.: I read just now, shortly before uploading, that
uGame has been discontinued in favour of a new board by Adafruit
called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200">PyBadge</a> (see <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/27629-game/log/164355-the-last-game">The Last uGame</a>). If all of this sounded very tinkery
to you and scared you off the very interesting field of Python
on the microcontroller, you may want to try out the Adafruit board instead
which is certainly more mature.
Personally, I have no intention of buying one, as I am quite content with my uGame
(I hope you could tell :)&nbsp;).</p>
